# Challenge Resolution

The design of this resolution was intended to be as close as possible from the layout provided on the challenge. We can see an image of the result below.

It was defined a max and a min height for the input so it does not get too big nor cover the chart completely. To protect the page from too many inputs it was set that after 1000 different values of timestamps processed on data events the system will stop processing data events. This way, the only way to input more data to the system would be starting a new chart, that would delete all the data from the previous chart.
